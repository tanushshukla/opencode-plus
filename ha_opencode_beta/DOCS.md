# OpenCode Beta

This is the **beta channel** for the OpenCode add-on. It contains experimental features and fixes that are being validated before inclusion in the stable release.

**You can install this alongside the stable OpenCode add-on.** Both appear in the sidebar (as "OpenCode" and "OpenCode Beta").

What is separate: each add-on has its own storage, so sessions, credentials, the OpenCode binary and generated context never mix. Decision notes are separate too — beta keeps its at `/config/opencode_beta/decisions.yaml`, and copies your existing notes there once on first start so nothing is lost. Anything you record while testing beta stays out of your stable sessions.

The beta add-on does not write to your configuration directory at all beyond its own notes. In particular it no longer deploys `AGENTS.md` there — that file belongs to the stable add-on, and beta keeps its own copy inside the add-on instead. If you previously ran beta on its own, it removes the copy it left behind, unless you edited it or the stable add-on has since taken it over.

What is shared, because it is your Home Assistant configuration directory and both add-ons work in it: your actual configuration files, and `AGENTS.local.md` — your own instructions, which neither add-on ever writes and both always load.

The `4096`/`4097` ports listed under Network are *container* ports and do not clash between the two add-ons. If you expose both add-ons' LAN ports, give each a different host port.

## Current Beta Changes

- **Home context**: Sessions now start knowing your installation. A generated **Install briefing** describes your setup (version, areas, entity counts, configuration layout, integrations), **decision notes** carry lasting decisions between sessions once you approve them, and `AGENTS.local.md` holds your own instructions where add-on updates cannot overwrite them. Both options default on and switch off independently. See [Home Context (Beta)](#home-context-beta).
- **OpenChamber interface mode**: New experimental `openchamber` interface mode starts the OpenChamber web UI behind Home Assistant Ingress, while the default `terminal` mode keeps the existing ttyd terminal unchanged.
- **Native Home Assistant MCP bridge**: Optional bridge from OpenCode to Home Assistant Core's native LLM MCP endpoint (`/api/mcp/<API ID>`, default `assist`) for testing the new native LLM/MCP platform when the running Home Assistant version supports it.
- **Compact Home Assistant context**: New `get_home_context` MCP tool gives agents focused area/domain/entity context with area and device metadata instead of broad state dumps.
- **Native LLM provider development guide**: New `get_ha_llm_development_guide` MCP tool helps custom integration authors build `<integration>/llm.py` tool providers aligned with Home Assistant's upstream architecture.
- **Serial device access**: Selected host UART/serial devices can be mapped into the add-on for USB flashing and adapter inspection workflows. Full Supervisor `uart` and `udev` manifest flags remain disabled by default because they are static permissions, not runtime user options.
- **Optional LAN server mode**: You can now enable an OpenCode server bound to `0.0.0.0` so other computers on your local network can connect directly.
- **Optional OpenChamber LAN web UI**: When using `interface_mode: openchamber`, you can optionally publish OpenChamber on a mapped LAN port (`4097/tcp`) at the root path `/` for reverse proxies and tunnels.
- **LAN server CORS origins**: The LAN server can now allow-list specific browser origins (`--cors`), so browser-based OpenCode clients — not just the CLI — can connect to it directly. See [LAN Server Mode (Beta)](#lan-server-mode-beta) below.
- **PPQ private TEE models**: Opt-in encrypted proxy for PPQ private models running in remote TEEs. The proxy is internal-only and binds to `127.0.0.1` inside the add-on container.
- **Web terminal clipboard fixes**: Copying inside OpenCode now reaches the browser clipboard, plain `Ctrl+V` paste works, and macOS users can use `Option+drag` to select text while full-screen terminal apps capture the mouse.
- **Touch scrolling**: One-finger vertical drag gestures inside the terminal now scroll full-screen apps such as OpenCode on phones and tablets.
- **OpenCode update policy**: Use only the image-bundled OpenCode (`bundled`, default, lowest memory use) or keep OpenCode updated to the newest release in the background (`latest`, skipped automatically on low-memory systems).
- **Sensitive file protection**: New **Restrict access to sensitive files** option (default on) denies the AI read access to `secrets.yaml`, `.storage/`, `.cloud/`, `ssl/`, and `*.key`/`*.pem` files so their contents can't reach the model. Set it to `false` to restore fully unrestricted file access. See [Sensitive File Protection](#sensitive-file-protection).
- **Focus-friendly responses**: Optional action-first, concise, progress-aware response guidance for users who find long or unstructured responses difficult to act on. Disabled by default and available in both terminal and OpenChamber modes.
- **Browser provider sign-in in OpenChamber**: Providers whose browser OAuth method redirects to a loopback address (for example **ChatGPT Pro/Plus (browser)**) can now be connected from the OpenChamber UI. See [Connecting a provider with browser sign-in](#connecting-a-provider-with-browser-sign-in).

## Home Context (Beta)

Four files decide what OpenCode knows about your installation before you type anything. Run `ha-context show` in the terminal to read every one of them, and `ha-context status` to see what each costs.

| File | What it is | Who writes it |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| `/config/AGENTS.md` | The add-on's own instructions | The add-on, refreshed on update |
| `/config/AGENTS.local.md` | **Your** standing instructions | You; the add-on never touches it |
| `/data/context/home-briefing.md` | Generated summary of your setup | The add-on, rebuilt on every start |
| `/config/opencode/decisions.yaml` | Lasting decisions you approved | OpenCode, only when you say yes |

**Your own instructions.** Create `/config/AGENTS.local.md` for standing preferences — "all Zigbee goes through Zigbee2MQTT", "new config goes in `packages/`", "always show me the diff first". A commented example lands at `/config/AGENTS.local.md.example` on first install. Add-on updates never overwrite it, `AGENTS.md` still wins on conflict, and deleting the file turns it off.

This also fixes a real problem: `AGENTS.md` used to be refreshed on every add-on update whenever it still carried its original heading, which quietly discarded customizations added to it. The add-on now compares the file against what it last wrote and leaves edited copies alone, keeping a `.bak` copy the first time it cannot tell.

**Install briefing** (option, default on). Regenerated at every start: Home Assistant version and installation type, how your configuration is split up (including whether `automations.yaml` is UI-managed), your areas and floors by name, entity counts per domain, integrations and device stacks, and your custom components. It is rebuilt rather than appended to and capped at roughly 500 tokens, so it cannot grow. It is produced by the add-on, not the AI, and never contains `secrets.yaml` values, tokens, or your coordinates.

**Decision notes** (option, default on). Configuration records *what*; notes record *why* — that an integration was removed deliberately, that a toggle is inverted on purpose, that some corner should be left alone. OpenCode proposes a note and writes it only after you approve. Notes are plain YAML in `/config/opencode/decisions.yaml`. Each active note is injected as one line — date, title, decision, and any entities, files or integrations attached to it; rationale and retired notes stay in the file and are fetched on demand via `recall_decisions`. The digest is capped at roughly 500 tokens and up to 40 active notes are stored, so when there are more notes than fit the digest says how many it is showing and the rest stay in force in the file — add `pin: true` to a note to keep it in the digest. Replaced notes are marked superseded rather than deleted, so the per-request cost stays flat. Notes containing a credential or a value from your `secrets.yaml` are rejected.

Adds three MCP tools: `remember_decision`, `recall_decisions`, `supersede_decision`. With the option off, they are not offered to the AI at all and your existing notes file is left untouched.

## Focus-Friendly Response Mode (Beta)

Turn on **Focus-friendly responses (beta)** in the add-on **Configuration** tab and restart the add-on. The mode shapes OpenCode responses to lead with the next action or result, number multi-step work, show progress, keep ordinary lists short, and end with one concrete next step.

This is an output-formatting preference, not a medical feature. It does not diagnose ADHD, create a health profile, change model access, grant permissions, or bypass confirmations. Home Assistant safety requirements remain in effect: proposed changes, validation results, backups, destructive-action warnings, and explicit approval are still required. Ask for an explanation or walkthrough when you want more detail.

## Add-on Folder Access

OpenCode mounts `/addons` and `/addon_configs` for Home Assistant add-on development access. Turn on **Add-on folder guidance** in the add-on configuration and restart to show these paths in the terminal. This option updates guidance, but the mounts are static add-on metadata and are not a hard filesystem permission boundary.

Treat `/addon_configs` as sensitive because it may contain configuration data for other add-ons.

## Sensitive File Protection

By default (**Restrict access to sensitive files** = `true`), the add-on adds an OpenCode `permission.read` rule that blocks the AI's file-**read** tool from opening secret/credential files — `secrets.yaml` (any path ending in `secrets.yaml`), the `.storage/` and `.cloud/` directories, the `ssl/` directory, and any `*.key`/`*.pem` files — so their contents can't be pulled into the model's context. Everything else stays readable, and the agent can still edit normal config that *references* secrets via `!secret`. The Home Assistant MCP tools are unaffected; they read live state through the API.

**To restore the previous, fully-permissive behavior,** set **Restrict access to sensitive files** to `false` and restart. You can also fine-tune paths via **Custom OpenCode configuration** using OpenCode's [permission rules](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/).

**Scope/limitation:** this guards OpenCode's file-read tool (the common accidental-exposure path). It does **not** restrict shell commands, so an explicit `cat secrets.yaml` can still read the file — treat it as a strong guardrail, not a hard sandbox.

## Resource Usage

OpenCode snapshots are disabled by default in this add-on to reduce memory and disk pressure on Home Assistant systems. File watching also ignores noisy internal paths such as `.storage/`, `.cloud/`, caches, logs, and the Home Assistant database. You can override these defaults with **Custom OpenCode configuration** if you need OpenCode's built-in snapshot/undo behavior.

On low-memory hosts — for example a 4 GB Home Assistant Green running several other add-ons — keep **OpenCode update policy** on `bundled` (the default) so the add-on does no memory-heavy start-up install. 8 GB or more is recommended for comfortable use alongside other memory-heavy add-ons such as Matter Server, Music Assistant, and Whisper/Piper.

## OpenCode Updates

By default, **OpenCode update policy** is set to `bundled`: the add-on uses the OpenCode version shipped in its image and does no start-up install — the lowest-memory option, recommended for systems with 4 GB RAM or limited free memory.

Set the policy to `latest` to follow upstream OpenCode releases. The add-on starts immediately on the bundled (or an existing healthy persistent) binary, then refreshes `opencode-ai@latest` into `/data/.npm-global` **in the background**; the newer version becomes active for the next OpenCode session. The background update never blocks start-up and is skipped automatically when available memory is below ~1.5 GB. An interrupted or non-working update is discarded so the add-on keeps using the known-good bundled copy.

### CPU requirements

OpenCode is a Bun-compiled binary, so Bun's CPU floor applies: an x64 processor must support **SSE4.2** (the x86-64-v2 level — Intel Nehalem/2008 or newer, AMD Bulldozer/2011 or Jaguar/2013 or newer). Below that line every OpenCode binary exits immediately with `Illegal instruction (core dumped)` and no add-on setting changes it; the add-on detects this at start-up and says so in its log. ARM64 is unaffected.

The regular x64 build additionally requires **AVX2** (Haswell/2013 or newer), and the add-on falls back to OpenCode's *baseline* build when AVX2 is missing. Note that upstream currently publishes the regular AVX2 binary inside the baseline package ([anomalyco/opencode#33595](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/33595)) — the two are byte-identical in the shipped versions, so baseline mode does not presently rescue a CPU without AVX2.

For x64 VM installs, make sure the guest can see AVX2 when the host supports it. Generic QEMU/KVM CPU models can hide AVX2 and force OpenCode's baseline binary unnecessarily.

## Native Home Assistant MCP Bridge (Beta)

Home Assistant has a native `llm` integration and native MCP endpoints for registered LLM APIs. PR [home-assistant/developers.home-assistant#3236](https://github.com/home-assistant/developers.home-assistant/pull/3236) documents the contract: every registered LLM API is exposed at `/api/mcp/<API ID>` once Home Assistant's MCP Server integration is set up. The built-in Assist API uses the API ID `assist`.

**Which Home Assistant version you need:** the `llm` integration, the per-domain LLM tool platforms, and the keyed `/api/mcp/<API ID>` endpoints all first ship in **Home Assistant 2026.8**. On 2026.7.x and earlier, Home Assistant serves only the configured `/api/mcp` endpoint and the legacy `/mcp_server/sse` transport. In every case the **MCP Server** integration must be added in Home Assistant first — the endpoints are not served otherwise.

When **Native Home Assistant MCP bridge (beta)** is on, the add-on adds a second OpenCode MCP server named `homeassistant_native` that forwards requests to the configured Home Assistant Core native endpoint through the Supervisor proxy. **Native MCP API ID** defaults to `assist`, which targets `/api/mcp/assist`. Set it to a custom API ID to test `/api/mcp/<your API ID>` for custom APIs registered inside Home Assistant. Leave it empty to target Home Assistant's configured `/api/mcp` endpoint instead.

### What you have to do

The bridge is **off by default**, and Home Assistant does not serve its MCP endpoints until you set the integration up. Two one-time steps, in this order:

1. **Add the Model Context Protocol Server integration in Home Assistant.** Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and add **Model Context Protocol Server**. Until this exists, Home Assistant registers no `/api/mcp` routes at all and the bridge has nothing to talk to on any version.
2. **Turn on the bridge in the add-on and restart it.** Set **Enable native Home Assistant MCP bridge** to on in the add-on's Configuration tab, then restart the add-on. The setting is read once at start-up, so it does not take effect until the restart.

To confirm it worked, ask OpenCode to run `get_agent_capabilities`: it reports the detected Home Assistant version, which endpoint the bridge resolved to, and any upstream limitations that still apply. In OpenCode you should also see a second MCP server named `homeassistant_native` alongside the built-in `homeassistant` one.

Nothing else is required. You do **not** need to change the API ID, set any environment variable, or supply an access token — the bridge authenticates with the Supervisor token. If you skip step 1, the bridge starts and every request fails with a 404, which `get_agent_capabilities` will report.

Once it is on, the bridge handles Home Assistant versions by itself and needs no further attention when you upgrade — including across the 2026.8 boundary, which it picks up without a restart.

Access model from Home Assistant Core: `/api/mcp` serves **every** LLM API selected in the MCP Server integration — that setting is a multi-select — and needs no admin access. `/api/mcp/<API ID>` narrows to one registered LLM API and requires admin access for every ID except the built-in Assist API.

That admin requirement is not a wall for this add-on. The Supervisor calls Home Assistant Core as its own system user, which Home Assistant creates in the admin group, so **any registered API ID is reachable from here** — which is what makes testing a custom LLM API from your own integration practical. If the bridge reports an unknown API ID, the ID does not exist; it is not an access failure.

The bridge adapts itself to what your Home Assistant actually serves:

- **Endpoint fallback.** If the keyed `/api/mcp/<API ID>` endpoint is not served — which is the case before 2026.8 — the bridge falls back to the configured `/api/mcp` endpoint and logs the reason once. It retries the keyed endpoint periodically, so upgrading Home Assistant to 2026.8 under a running add-on is picked up without a restart. If Home Assistant instead reports that the API ID is unknown, the bridge surfaces that error rather than silently serving a different API. Set `HA_NATIVE_MCP_ENDPOINT_MODE` to `keyed` or `configured` in **Environment variables** to pin one endpoint instead.
- **Tool schema repair.** Before Home Assistant 2026.8, tools whose parameters use validators such as `cv.string` produced a schema that strict MCP clients cannot compile; calls then failed with `extra keys not allowed @ data['__unparsedToolInput']`, which affected `GetLiveContext` in particular ([home-assistant/core#176762](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/176762), fixed by [#176814](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/176814)). The bridge repairs these schemas as they pass through. Set `HA_NATIVE_MCP_SANITIZE_SCHEMAS` to `0` to see the raw upstream schemas.
- **Malformed-message guard.** Every message is validated as JSON-RPC 2.0 before it is forwarded, because malformed POSTs to `/api/mcp` have been reported to crash Home Assistant Core ([home-assistant/core#176734](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/176734)). This one is **not fixed in 2026.8** — the upstream fix is still open — so the guard applies on every version.

Run `get_agent_capabilities` to see what the running instance supports; it reports the detected version, the endpoint status, and any known upstream limitations that apply to it. OpenCode's regular `homeassistant` MCP server remains the supported tool surface either way.

The two MCP servers are intentionally separate:

- `homeassistant_native`: Home Assistant's curated native LLM API tools from the configured `/api/mcp/<API ID>` endpoint when available.
- `homeassistant`: OpenCode's add-on tools for configuration editing, validation, diagnostics, screenshots, updates, ESPHome, Zigbee, add-on development, and documentation lookup.

## Interface Mode (Beta)

The beta add-on can show either the existing terminal interface or the experimental OpenChamber web UI in the Home Assistant sidebar.

Modes:

- `terminal`: default. Uses the existing ttyd terminal and tmux session.
- `openchamber`: starts OpenChamber behind Home Assistant Ingress on the same sidebar entry.

To test OpenChamber:

1. In the add-on **Configuration** tab, set **Interface mode** to `openchamber`.
2. Save and restart the add-on.
3. Open **OpenCode Beta** from the Home Assistant sidebar.

Security and networking notes:

- OpenChamber is not exposed through a Home Assistant Network port by default.
- The OpenChamber process binds to `127.0.0.1` inside the container.
- A small first-party ingress proxy binds to internal port `8099`, accepts Home Assistant Ingress traffic, and forwards to OpenChamber locally.
- Home Assistant Ingress provides the browser authentication layer, so no separate OpenChamber UI password is configured for this mode.
- LAN access remains the separate opt-in **OpenCode LAN server** feature on port `4096`.

Known beta risk: OpenChamber is a root-hosted web app, so this beta includes a pinned bundle patch for Home Assistant's `/api/hassio_ingress/...` path. If the page loads but actions fail, switch **Interface mode** back to `terminal`, restart the add-on, and include logs when reporting the issue.

OpenChamber's own built-in update check is disabled in this add-on. OpenChamber is pinned and patched for Home Assistant Ingress when the add-on image is built, so an in-app self-update cannot persist or stay patched and would only hang the UI. OpenChamber is updated by updating the add-on — no "update available" prompt appears inside OpenChamber, and the Update button in **Settings → OpenChamber → About** reports no update.

### Connecting a provider with browser sign-in

Some providers offer a **browser** sign-in method (for example **ChatGPT Pro/Plus (browser)**) that sends you back to `http://localhost:<port>/auth/callback` after you sign in. That address is the add-on container, not the computer you are browsing from, so the final redirect always fails to load with a connection error. That is expected and does not mean the sign-in failed.

In **Settings → Providers**, copy the whole `http://localhost:...` URL from your browser's address bar, paste it into the **Paste authorization code** field, and select **Complete** — the add-on delivers it to OpenCode locally so the sign-in finishes. Pasting only the `code=` value from that URL works too. In `terminal` mode, use the provider's **headless** method instead, which shows a short code to enter on the provider's device-authorization page and needs no redirect at all.

## Zigbee2MQTT URL

The add-on discovers a running Zigbee2MQTT add-on automatically, so **Zigbee2MQTT URL** is only needed as a manual override. Set it to the same address and port you open the Zigbee2MQTT UI on, including the scheme — for example `http://192.168.1.20:8080`. Host/IP-only values are accepted and treated as `http://`.

## LAN Server Mode (Beta)

LAN server mode lets you attach to the Home Assistant-hosted OpenCode session from a terminal outside the Home Assistant UI.

To enable LAN access:

1. In the add-on **Configuration** tab, turn on **OpenCode LAN server**.
2. In the add-on **Network** settings, map `4096/tcp` to the host port you want to use.
3. Save and restart the add-on.

On the secondary computer, use `opencode attach` with your Home Assistant host IP and configured port:

```bash
opencode attach http://<home-assistant-ip>:<mapped-host-port>
```

Example, if you mapped `4096/tcp` to host port `4096`:

```bash
opencode attach http://192.168.1.50:4096
```

The add-on log shows the current Home Assistant port mapping when the server starts, for example `Home Assistant port mapping: 4096/tcp -> 3443`. If OpenCode also prints `opencode server listening on http://0.0.0.0:4096`, that is the internal container listener, not the URL to use from another computer. Use your Home Assistant host and the mapped host port instead.

Security warning: enabling this service and mapping the port exposes an OpenCode server on your LAN. Only use this on trusted networks, restrict access with your network/firewall controls, and never expose the port to the internet or untrusted networks.

## OpenChamber LAN Web UI (Beta)

By default the OpenChamber web UI (`interface_mode: openchamber`) is served **only** through Home Assistant Ingress at `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/`. That is the recommended path because Home Assistant provides the authentication layer.

If you instead want a clean root URL for a reverse proxy or tunnel — for example so `https://openchamber.example.com/` maps straight to a backend without an ingress-path redirect/rewrite — enable the OpenChamber LAN web UI. It publishes OpenChamber on a mappable network port and serves it at the root path `/`.

To enable it:

1. Set **Interface mode** to `openchamber`.
2. Set **Enable OpenChamber LAN web UI** to `true`.
3. In the add-on **Network** settings, map `4097/tcp` to the host port you want to use.
4. Save and restart the add-on.

Then open the UI at:

```text
http://<home-assistant-host>:<mapped-host-port>/
```

Behind a Cloudflare Tunnel, point a public hostname straight at it (no redirect rule needed because it already serves at `/`):

```yaml
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: openchamber.example.com
    service: http://<home-assistant-host>:<mapped-host-port>
```

How it works:

- A second instance of the OpenChamber ingress proxy binds to `0.0.0.0:4097` and forwards to the same OpenChamber process on `127.0.0.1:3010`.
- Because the mapped port has no Home Assistant Ingress session, the proxy runs with `OPENCHAMBER_ALLOW_ANY_REMOTE=true` and serves the UI with an empty ingress path (root `/`).
- The default Ingress instance on `8099` is unchanged and keeps its strict `127.0.0.1` / Supervisor-only allowlist.

Security warning: there is **no Home Assistant login** in front of the mapped `4097/tcp` port. Anyone who can reach it can use OpenChamber, which has read/write access to your configuration. Only map it on trusted networks, and put it behind a reverse proxy, Cloudflare Access, or equivalent authentication before any remote exposure. Never expose the raw port directly to the internet.

### Connecting a browser-based client (CORS)

`opencode attach` and other non-browser clients work out of the box with the steps above. Browser-based clients that call the LAN server directly — for example the [OpenChamber VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fedaykindev.openchamber)'s `openchamber.apiUrl` setting, or any other web/VS Code UI pointed at this server instead of its own local instance — are subject to the browser's CORS policy. Without an allowed origin, this can look like a partial connection: the client may still list providers/models, but sending a chat message or opening the event stream silently gets no response.

To fix this:

1. In the client, find the exact origin it's making requests from (scheme + host + port, no path). Your browser's developer tools Network tab will show this as the `Origin` request header, or as the URL of the page/webview hosting the client.
2. In the add-on **Configuration** tab, add that origin under **LAN server CORS origins**, for example `http://192.168.1.20:8080`.
3. Save and restart the add-on.

This option only adds `--cors <origin>` flags to the OpenCode server; it does not change anything else about LAN server mode, and leaving it empty preserves the existing `opencode attach` behavior exactly.

## PPQ Private TEE Models (Beta)

PPQ private mode routes OpenCode requests through a local encryption proxy before forwarding them to PPQ's private inference API. The proxy verifies the remote enclave, encrypts the request locally, and decrypts the response locally.

To enable PPQ private models:

1. Get a PPQ API key from PPQ.
2. In the add-on **Configuration** tab, turn on **PPQ private TEE models (beta)**.
3. Paste the key into **PPQ API Key**. Alternatively, set `PPQ_API_KEY` through **Environment Variables** if you manage credentials that way.
4. Save and restart the add-on.
5. In OpenCode, select the `PPQ Private (TEE)` provider and one of the `private/...` models.

Security notes:

- The proxy binds only to `127.0.0.1:8787` inside the add-on container.
- No Home Assistant network port is exposed for PPQ private mode.
- The PPQ API key is not logged.
- The proxy package is pinned at image build time; the add-on does not run `npx latest` at startup.

Bundled model IDs come from the pinned `ppq-private-mode` package version: `private/kimi-k2-5`, `private/deepseek-r1-0528`, `private/gpt-oss-120b`, `private/llama3-3-70b`, and `private/qwen3-vl-30b`.
