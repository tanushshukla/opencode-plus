# Promote the beta channel's code to stable.
#
# Channels are folders, not branches. ha_opencode_beta/ and ha_opencode/ are
# each a complete add-on; what makes one of them "beta" is the ADDON_CHANNEL
# build arg its workflow passes, never anything written inside rootfs/. That is
# what lets promotion be a straight copy.
#
# Copied (the code):        Dockerfile, rootfs/, test/, .dockerignore
# Never copied (identity):  config.yaml, build.yaml, translations/, DOCS.md,
#                           CHANGELOG.md, icon.png, logo.png
#
# The metadata stays put because it carries the slug, image, version, panel
# title and per-channel pins. Copying it would publish beta's identity as
# stable — the exact failure this split exists to prevent.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/promote-beta-to-stable.sh --check   # report drift, change nothing
#   scripts/promote-beta-to-stable.sh           # copy beta's code onto stable

Done. Still to do by hand:

  1. On main, write the "## <version>" section in ha_opencode/CHANGELOG.md.
  2. On main, update ha_opencode/config.yaml to the promoted stable version,
     stage only the stable code, config, and changelog changes, commit them, and
     push to main.
  3. Let .github/workflows/auto-tag-stable.yml create v<version> and start the
     existing stable build/release workflows.
  4. If starting the next beta, make its changelog changes on dev as a separate
     change and use the existing manual beta-v* tag flow.
