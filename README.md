## ✨ About

**OpenCode+** brings the revolutionary [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI coding agent directly into your Home Assistant instance, with added **image paste** (copy an image and paste it into the terminal — OpenCode gets a file path) and **voice dictation** (click the Voice button to speak your prompts). Experience intelligent configuration editing through natural language, advanced YAML assistance, and deep integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

> **Upstream attribution:** This is an independent Home Assistant add-on that redistributes and integrates [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode), © 2025 opencode, under the MIT License.

### 🎯 Key Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

#### 🤖 **AI-Powered Editing**
Use natural language to modify your Home Assistant configuration. No more searching documentation - just ask!

#### 📷 **Image Paste Support**
Paste, drag-drop, or upload images directly into the terminal — they're saved to a path (`/data/images/pasted-*.png`) that OpenCode can read. Just paste an image from your clipboard!

#### 🎤 **Voice Dictation**
Click the Voice button to dictate prompts using your microphone (Web Speech API). Edit the transcript, copy it, and paste it into OpenCode.

#### 🎨 **Two Interface Modes**
Choose your experience from the sidebar: a beautiful web **terminal** with 10 themes, or the graphical **OpenChamber** web UI — both served through Home Assistant Ingress.

#### 🔌 **Provider Agnostic**
Works with **75+ AI providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Ollama, and many more.

</td>
<td width="50%">

#### 🔧 **Deep MCP Integration**
41 tools, 14 resources, and 6 guided prompts for comprehensive Home Assistant interaction.

#### 🧠 **Home Context**
Sessions start knowing your installation instead of rediscovering it. A generated briefing describes your setup, `AGENTS.local.md` holds your own standing instructions, and approved decision notes carry the reasoning behind your configuration between sessions.

#### 💡 **Intelligent LSP Support**
Smart YAML editing with entity autocomplete, live hover information, deprecation warnings, and go-to-definition support.

#### 🛡️ **Safe Config Writing**
Validated config pipeline with automatic backup/restore. Multi-layered checks are designed to prevent AI-written config from breaking your HA instance.

#### 🏗️ **hab CLI Integration**
Includes the [Home Assistant Builder CLI](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant-build-cli) by [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob) — a CLI purpose-built for AI agents to manage Home Assistant via REST and WebSocket APIs. Enables dashboard CRUD, area/floor management, helper creation, backup/restore, and bulk admin operations that would otherwise require direct API calls or UI interaction.

#### 🧭 **HA Native LLM Ready**
Tracks Home Assistant's emerging native `llm` integration and native MCP endpoints such as `/api/mcp/<API ID>`, reports readiness through MCP, and targets beta-channel bridge testing first.

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Install

1. **Add this repository to Home Assistant:**

   [![Add Repository][repo-btn]][repo-add]

   <details>
   <summary>Or add manually</summary>
   
   Go to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **Add-on Store** → **⋮** → **Repositories**
   
   Add: `https://github.com/tanushshukla/opencode-plus`
   </details>

2. **Install the add-on:**
   - Find **"OpenCode"** in the add-on store
   - Click **Install**

3. **Start using it:**
   - Start the add-on
   - Click **Open Web UI** (or use the sidebar)
   - Run `opencode` and use `/connect` to configure your AI provider

   > 💡 **Prefer a graphical interface?** Set **Interface Mode** to `openchamber` in the add-on **Configuration** tab and restart to swap the terminal for the [OpenChamber](https://github.com/openchamber/openchamber) web UI on the same sidebar entry. The default `terminal` mode is unchanged.

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Validation

> **This add-on has read/write access to your Home Assistant configuration directory.**

It also mounts Home Assistant add-on development folders (`/addons` and `/addon_configs`) so OpenCode can help with custom add-ons. Treat `/addon_configs` as sensitive because it may contain configuration data for other add-ons.

OpenCode includes a multi-layered validation pipeline designed to prevent AI-written configuration from causing your Home Assistant to fail to start:

- 🔍 **Automatic config validation** — every config write is validated through HA Core's own check before committing
- ↩️ **Automatic backup/restore** — if validation fails, the original file is instantly restored
- 🧪 **Jinja2 template pre-validation** — templates are tested through HA's engine before writing to disk
- 📋 **Deprecation scanning** — 20+ patterns catch outdated syntax, auto-updated from GitHub
- 🏥 **HA Repairs integration** — surfaces your installation's active deprecation warnings
- ⚠️ **Structural checks** — catches missing triggers, actions, and other required fields

**Additional best practices:**

- 💾 **Always backup** your configuration before significant changes
- 👀 **Review changes** suggested by the AI before accepting them  
- 📝 **Use version control** (git) when possible for easy rollback

## 🧭 Home Assistant Native LLM Roadmap

Home Assistant is developing a native `llm` integration so Core integrations and custom integrations can expose curated tools to Assist through `<integration>/llm.py` and registered LLM APIs over `/api/mcp/<API ID>`. OpenCode will follow this work closely and aims to be a premium consumer of the agent capabilities Home Assistant makes available.

Today, the add-on keeps MCP as the complete working tool surface, adds readiness reporting through `get_agent_capabilities` / `ha://agent/capabilities`, provides compact `get_home_context` discovery, and includes a native LLM provider guide for custom integration authors. The beta channel can opt into a configurable native MCP bridge targeting `/api/mcp/<API ID>` with `assist` as the default. As HA-native LLM capabilities become stable and accessible to add-ons, OpenCode will prefer native HA tools where they fit while keeping MCP for safe config writing, validation, admin/dev workflows, screenshots, firmware updates, and troubleshooting.

See the [full documentation][docs] for the current support status and long-term integration plan.
